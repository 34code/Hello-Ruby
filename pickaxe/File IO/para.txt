At this point, a quick test may be in order.
To do this, we’re going to use a testing framework called Test::Unit that comes with the standard Ruby distributions. 
We won’t describe it fully yet (we do that in the Unit Testing chapter starting on page 198). 
For now, we’ll just say that the method assert_equal checks that its two parameters are equal, complaining bitterly if they aren’t. 
We’ll use assertions to test our two methods, one method at a time. 
(That’s one reason why we wrote them as separate methods—it makes them testable in isolation.)
